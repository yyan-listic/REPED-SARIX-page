<strong> Recursive and robust displacement estimation from SAR image time series </strong>

The main objective of this work package (WP) is to develop recursive and robust multi-temporal InSAR approaches for displacement estimation from SAR image time series. The interferometric phase estimation is formulated as a covariance matrix estimation problem. This work package is based on two Ph.D. theses. In the Ph.D. thesis of Hoa Viet Phan Vu (10/2020–12/2023), we first proposed a new phase linking approach based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), and then extended this work to a general covariance fitting framework. In the Ph.D. thesis of Dana El Hajjar (12/2022– ), sequential algorithms are being developed, based on MLE-Phase Linking and covariance fitting, to efficiently integrate new images (either one by one or block by block).

  - Maximum-Likelihood-Estimator (MLE) Phase Linking
 
We start from the state-of-the-art Phase Linking approach. The N-1 phase difference is estimated directly from a time series of N coregistered SAR images based on a maximum likelihood estimator. The first contribution lies on the joint estimation of the interferometric phase and coherence, which results of superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art Phase Linking.
