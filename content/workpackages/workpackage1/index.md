<strong> Recursive and robust displacement estimation from SAR image time series </strong>

The main objective of this WP is to develop recursive and robust multi-temporal InSAR approaches for displacement estimation from SAR image time series. The interferometric phase estimation is formulated as a covariance matrix estimation problem. This work package is based on two Ph.D theses. In the former, 

  - Maximum-Likelihood-Estimator (MLE) Phase Linking
  
  We start from the state-of-the-art Phase Linking approach. The N-1 phase difference is estimated directly from a time series of N coregistered SAR images based on a maximum likelihood estimator.

  - Covariance fitting
  
  - Sequential MLE Phase Linking
  
  - Sequential covariance fitting
