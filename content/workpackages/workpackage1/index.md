** Recursive and robust displacement estimation from SAR image time series **

The main objective of this WP is to develop a recursive and robust multi-temporal InSAR approach for displacement estimation from SAR image time series. We start from the Phase Linking approach. The displacement rate is estimated directly from a time series of N coregistered SAR images based on a maximum likelihood estimator.

Task I: robust multi-temporal InSAR

Task II: recursive multi-temporal InSAR 

Task III: Missing data imputation
