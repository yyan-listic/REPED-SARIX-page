The systematic acquisition of and free access to Sentinel-1 A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images provide scientists with both opportunities and challenges for operational monitoring of Earth deformation by SAR image time series. In this project, the coordinator brings together, for the first time, Interferometry SAR, statistical learning, deep learning and geophysics skills in order to form an interdisciplinary team who aims to promote methodological development for operational Earth deformation monitoring and natural hazard prediction by SAR image time series. For this, we start from single look complex SAR image time series and deal with displacement estimation and natural hazard prediction problems by means of both statistics based learning and neural networks based learning approaches. The proposed methods will be applied to targets of geophysical interest, including volcanoes and glaciers covered by Sentinel-1 A/B SAR image time series.
